 o Check that readColumns doesn't fail on missing rows.  Or if not
 possible, it should be well documented.  See an example that crashes: 
"S:/All/Structured
 Risk/NEPOOL/FTRs/ISODatabase/NEPOOL/Attrition/NSTAR/CustomerCounts/Raw/customer-info-april-2010.xls" 

 o Make sure that the combo write.xlsx2/read.xlsx2 is idempotent.
 Seems like write.xlsx2 creates an extra column?


 o Document if bold can be set on XSSF docs only. 

 o Embed RData objects with the xlsx.  Requested by Ralf Tautenhahn on
   2/1/2010.
